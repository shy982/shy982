- 👋 Hey there, I’m Shyam! Thanks for Stopping by!
- 👀 I've delved deep in the realms of Deep Generative, Actor-critic, and Model Agnostic MLSys development. Enjoy working on Computer Vision and RL-based projects. Intend to push for AI in Medicine & Healthcare. I love me some Full-stack Web Dev and UI/UX Engineering too. Recently been maxxing out my GPU for some Crypto Mining! 
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at UC San Diego learning Recommender Systems, Probabilistic Reasoning, and much more!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI-aaS projects, interdisciplinary ergonomic AI applications and also would love to contribute to OS UI development (Let's see how that goes ;-))
- 📫 Drop me a DM on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shyam-r-9201/), or Holler me on my email (shyam.9201.08@gmail.com) if you're interested to collaborate on something cool!
